**Build real-world, large-scale AR solutions for various industries**

## What is this book about?
Augmented reality (AR) is expanding its scope from just being used in mobile and game applications to enterprise. Different industries are using AR to enhance assembly line visualization, guide operators performing difficult tasks, attract more customers, and even improve training techniques. In this book, you'll gain comprehensive insights into different aspects of developing AR-based apps for six different enterprise sectors, focusing on market needs and choosing the most suitable tool in each case.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Understand the basics of Unity application development and C# scripting
* Learn how to use Android Studio along with ARCore and Sceneform to build AR prototypes for Android devices
* Enable AR experiences on the web with ARCore and WebAR
* Explore emerging AR authoring tools such as Augmented Class! for education
* Understand the differences and similarities between handheld and head-mounted display (HMD) environments and how to build an app for each target
